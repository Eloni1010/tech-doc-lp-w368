    <p>When playing Splatoon, the main part of the game that most people play is Turf war. Turf war is a mode where your goal is to paint as much of the available turf, while fighting against the other team for territory. To be able to truly thrive in this mode, you must learn how to properly use the tools available to you.</p>

    <header >Splatfest</header>
    <p>Splatfest changes both how much experience you gain, but also how the turf war games work. During splatfests, you pick a team based on that fest’s specific theme, as an example of a past theme, “Which is most important to you? Past vs Present vs Future” in which team Past won. During a splatfest, you’ll battle for that team throughout the fest, and gain more experience as you do, along with have a chance for X10 and X100 battles, which can net you even more points.</p>
    <code>If Splatfest=active, Increase Exp Gain, +60 win, +20 loss
  Else, Exp gain +600 win, +300 loss</code>
  </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Shops">
